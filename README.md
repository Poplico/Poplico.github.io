Website design credit to Sean Liew,
if that wasn't clear. I am a first year student studying
Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, and am 
currently in my 1B term. Some of what I have done: 

Quiz based geography mini-game 
designed and built in Visual Basic

Stock picking and tracking website that utilizes 
HTML/CSS, Javascript, PHP code as well as API interactions,
a custom built MySQL database system for login, registration,
ownership of stocks, and statistics tracking.

I also have working knowledge of Racket, and Java which were learned
as course material throughout my education.
